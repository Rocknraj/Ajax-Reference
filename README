This is a code base with three purposes.

1. Using git for version control and repository

2. Creating a set of Ajax code covering the full base of the Ajax technology
family and its uses

3. Working with the SASS tool for CSS creation

index.php - just like it's name says, this includes a static introduction to the whole project,
reads the directory to create links to the HTML files and reads them via Curl to include 
descriptions on the page.

testXX.html - these files include the Ajax functionalities and their descriptions. Using
Gorbatchev syntax highlighter to highlight the source code examples. Using the jQuery
library and its Ajax object.

testXX.php - these files are the server side processing scipts that the .html Ajax files
are communicating with. As in Ajax, these files pretty much stay in the background and
are not presented to the user. Their source code is shown and explained in the .html files.
The numbers in their name corresponds to the .html file that communicates with them,
i.e.: test2.php is called via Ajax from test02.html.
